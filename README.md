# Coach_and_player_candy_problem

This a toy problem for beginners in python. 

# Description

For a given number of day and an estimated number of candies (guess), coach rewards home runs with candy to motivate a player during training. Then, we want to predict the maximum distance, using guess (the number of candies) and check in order to do an effective training. From a guess (number of candies), we roll two dice, one for the number of candies and one for the distance the player has to travel, so the outcomes will be random.
